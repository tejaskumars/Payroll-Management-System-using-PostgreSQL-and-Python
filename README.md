I lead this project where we built a payroll management system database from scratch, we came up with an E-R diagram, then implemented it with PostgreSQL. we also built a CLI with Python to operate and perform simple to complex queries. The related files ad pdfs are added in the repository. <br  />
Steps to excecute the project :  <br  />
-> install postgreSQL on your System  <br  />
-> Run create.sql and insert.sql programms  <br  />
-> Install psycopg2 through "pip install psycopg2"  <br  />
-> replace user and password in line 4 of CLI.py with your credentials.  <br  />
-> run the program and you're good to go.  <br  />
